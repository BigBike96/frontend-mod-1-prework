## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

The *SuperLearner Article* resonated with me by stating pieces of advice that I have found to be true.
From the list of recommendations, I already make sure to take scheduled breaks. I also make a point to take care of my brain. I think I need to try to teach others more often to re-enforce the things I have learned. I also need to remember to treat learning as a process. I'm reminded of a friend who is an avid fisher who likes to say "People that want to learn how to fish usually learn to catch fish, where people who want to just catch fish don't learn how to catch may fish". The big thing I would add to this list would fall under the _Take care of your brain_ category. I would add _maintain cardio fitness_. The brain needs oxygen. The more efficient the body is at delivering oxygen to the brain, the better the brain performs.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

**Boolean** is a variable with 2 possible values. In JavaScript, true/false is used. True has a boolean value of 1. False has a boolean value of 0.
**String** is a sequence of items strung together. This sequence of items is wrapped in quotes `" "`. A string can consist of letters, characters, or numbers.
**Number** is how the computer represents numerical values. A number can be an *integer* or a *float*. Integers are whole numbers and floats can be expressed as a decimal.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

var greeting = "Hello World";

console.log(greeting);

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

`//` are used for *line* or *in-line* comments. They will comment out the text that follows.
`/* */` are used for *multi-line* or *block* comments. They wrap the comment and can be used for multiple lines.
A code comment helps explain a line of code or what a piece of code does. They can be helpful for other developer looking at the code. They can also help one's future self when revisiting previously written code.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

A variable is created to hold data. A variable can be thought of as a bowl, and the data can be thought of as the cereal. In order to store the amount of cereal to be eaten, we put it in a bowl.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

On the Amazon website I imagine variables that might be used would include `productName`, `productPrice`, and `discountCode`. `productName` would be a sting. `productPrice` would be a number (float). `discountCode` would be a string.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

Concatenation is the process of joining things together. It can be used to combine strings with other strings or variables.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?

When I would log into my rewards points website for car sales, it says 'Welcome, Jim!'. I imagine that my user name is concatenated into the string something like `'Welcome, ' + userName + '!'`.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

Are `let` and `const` considered variable keywords? What is it about these keywords that make them different than `var`?
