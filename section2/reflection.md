## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

Answer: When I am in the same physical location as the person that I would be asking the question of, I think I usually ask too soon since asking seems quick and easy. When I need to call/email/text a question I probably wait too long because I don't want to be a bother, or I have trouble figuring out the right question or how to ask the question.

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

Answer: I felt good checking outside resources. I like how a search engine result can give multiple answers. The only thing that might have felt uncomfortable is wondering if I had in fact found a valid answer. Not having all the information directly in front of me forced my to use more tools such as keyboard short cuts (to jump back and forth if needed), terminal short cuts (like pressing up arrow to pull up previous commands), and my bookmarks bar. I also found myself using my notes more.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

Answer: A conditional statement is a statement used to determine if JavaScript will run a piece of code.
A life conditional for me would be the weather. If the weather is good, I'll ride my bike. If the weather is bad, I won't ride my bike. A conditional in a web app might be: if searchItem === all, show all items, if searchItem === tires, just show tires.

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

Answer: To add multiple conditions to an `if` statement, use `else if` and/or `else`. The program will first read the `if` statement. If the `if` statement returns `true`, then JavaScript will run the code snippet directly following the `if`. If the `if` statement returns `false`, then JS will move to the following statement. If the following statement is `else if`, then JS will run the code following `else if` if the statement is `true`. If the `else if` statement returns `false`, then JS will not run the code snippet and will move on the the next `else if` statement, or the `else` statement. The code following the `else` statement will be run if the previous `if`, and `else if` statement(s) all return a value of `false`.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

Answer: Logical operators are a good tool to use. To check if two conditions are met, the && (AND) logical operator will work. To check if one of two conditions is met, the || (OR) logical operator will work.

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

Answer: I understand that it is best practice to use strictly equal to (===) over equal to (==). Is it also considered best practice to use strictly NOT equal to (!==) instead of NOT equal to (!=)?
