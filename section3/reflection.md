## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

Answer: One point that resonated with me from the video is to compare yourself to your past self, not to others. This reminded me of what a ski coach would tell us about race day. "Don't worry about how the other racers are skiing, worry about your own run". Occasionally there would be a world cup athlete at a race, so trying to compare myself to the worlds best wasn't exactly inspiring.
The S.M.A.R.T. goal setting is new to me. I have a hard time setting goals. When I try I often feel a great deal of self doubt. The idea to set goals that meet certain criteria (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound) is interesting to me. I hope it can help guide my thinking so I can feel more confident that my goals are taking me in the right direction.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

Answer: I currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset in how I practice, aim for perseverance, and accept feedback. I know from leaning how to do different things over the years that these elements are all essential to being able to do a new thing.
I currently lack a growth mindset in asking for help. I may feel too comfortable with doing things on my own. While confidence can be nice, it can turn into complacency when it comes to making the best of everyone's different experiences and expertise. We can accomplish more together than we can individually.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

Answer: On a video game bike racing app, the game will have rankings for how each racer is doing compared to other racers. I would imagine that the race results could be stored in an array, and the arrays could be compared to each other to determine racer rankings.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

Answer: An array method is a method used to access or manipulate the data/items in an array. These methods can add to, take away from, and return results from an array.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

Answer: The purpose of a loop is to repeat an action. Loops are often run when a specific condition evaluates to `true` or until a specific condition evaluates to `false`.
A loop would be used with an array when we want to perform a task using a group of related values. A loop might not require an array if the task does not need to access a group of values in order for the task to be performed.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

Answer: A loop is a way to figure out if a task is complete. If you need to put all of your toys away, you might look around the room and see if there are any more toys to be put in the toy box. If there are still toys on the ground, you need to continue to put them away. If there are no more toys on the ground, then the toys have all been put away, therefore the task is complete.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

Answer: I'm curious as to how the other types of loops (not `for` loops) are used?
