- What are you going to work on?

I plan on reviewing mod 0, and my mod 1 prework
  This includes the extensions in the finalProject
  I also plan on exploring other resources such as freecodecamp and repl

- What days are you going to work?

Every Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday at least 2 hours a day , and 2-3 other days for at least 1 hour a day

- What times on those days are you going to work?

Usually afternoons

- Where you going to be sitting/standing as you do this?

Either at my work desk, on a couch, or in my bedroom (and some on the back patio, weather permitting)

- Where are you documenting this plan? Google Calendar, calendar on your wall, your journal?

I'll start with the journal, maybe move it to a spreadsheet

- Do any stakeholders in your life know about this plan? (The answer needs to be yes by the time you answer this...)

Yes, all of them

- What personal items/events are important to you during this time? How are you going to make sure those are not neglected? (Hint, block time on the calendar for them!)

I might be heading out to moab for 3 days just before thanksgiving. One birthday in November. Otherwise, mornings will be for personal time
